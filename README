Jalopy:

  NOTE:
  apologies to users of jalopy as I was unaware of the documentation
  system labeld this -- expect a name change very soon.

  I've never used java before as you can plainly see. However,
  now I need to learn and I wanted an autotest suite that was
  like what I used in ruby -- this presents problems as ruby
  is dynamic and java is a compiled language.

SETUP:

  wget http://superb-east.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/junit/junit-4.5.jar
  mv junit-4.5.jar ~/.

  EDIT
   jalopy.java and change Line 13 to whatever path you have that points
   to junit-4.5.jar
 
  javac -cp ~/junit-4.5.jar *.java

TEST:
  yes, it tests itself -- actually the tests have not been written yet. ;)
  java jalopy

  try editing Testjalopy.java and changing line 13 to:
    assertEquals(1, 2);

  now try changing it back to:
    assertEquals(2, 2);
