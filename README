I checked in some code that breaks because it can't find a class that isn't on 

Easy fix.. but will wait until tomorrow ;-)
crappe:

  I've never used java before as you can plainly see. However,
  now I need to learn and I wanted an autotest suite that was
  like what I used in ruby.

SETUP:

  wget http://superb-east.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/junit/junit-4.5.jar
  mv junit-4.5.jar ~/.

  EDIT
   crappe.java and change Line 13 to whatever path you have that points
   to junit-4.5.jar
 
  javac -cp ~/junit-4.5.jar *.java

TEST:
  yes, it tests itself -- actually the tests have not been written yet. ;)
  java crappe

  try editing Testcrappe.java and changing line 13 to:
    assertEquals(1, 2);

  now try changing it back to:
    assertEquals(2, 2);
