Command line (*nix) for launching Crappe

java -Dfileio=lib/commons-io-1.4.jar -Djunitdir=lib/junit-4.8.2.jar -Dscandir=/Users/gakins/Projects/jautotest/src/test/java -DtestOutDir=/Users/gakins/Projects/jautotest/target/test-classes/ -jar crappe.jar --verbose

Unfortunately, I realized how little progress I've made.  As I start using this against more complicated applications, the classloading to dynamically compile the tests seems like it's going to get more and more cumbersome.

I'm not sure how much more I'll use this version.  I had hoped to continue using it while I created JAutoTest (Crappe 2.0).. but that seems like I might spend more time patching Crappe, than working on JAutoTest.

I checked in some code that breaks because it can't find a class that isn't on 

Easy fix.. but will wait until tomorrow ;-)
crappe:

  I've never used java before as you can plainly see. However,
  now I need to learn and I wanted an autotest suite that was
  like what I used in ruby.

SETUP:

  wget http://superb-east.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/junit/junit-4.5.jar
  mv junit-4.5.jar ~/.

  EDIT
   crappe.java and change Line 13 to whatever path you have that points
   to junit-4.5.jar
 
  javac -cp ~/junit-4.5.jar *.java

TEST:
  yes, it tests itself -- actually the tests have not been written yet. ;)
  java crappe

  try editing Testcrappe.java and changing line 13 to:
    assertEquals(1, 2);

  now try changing it back to:
    assertEquals(2, 2);
