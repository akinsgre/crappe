Jalopy:

  NOTE:
    apologies to users of jalopy as I was unaware of the documentation
  system labeld this -- expect a name change very soon.

  I've never used java before as you can plainly see. However,
now I need to learn and I wanted an autotest suite that was
like what I used in ruby -- this presents problems as ruby
is dynamic and java is a compiled language.

  Whatever, I don't give a rat's ass.

to setup:

  wget http://superb-east.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/junit/junit-4.5.jar
  mv junit-4.5.jar ~/.
  
  export CLASSPATH=~/junit-4.5.jar;
  javac *.java

to test:
  mv jalopy.class test/.
  java jalopy
  java org.junit.runner.JUnitCore Testhello

NOTES:
  I use screen and whole-heartedly recommend everyone else also.
